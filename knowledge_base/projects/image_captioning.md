# Project Deep Dive: Image Captioning with Attention Mechanism

This project focuses on building and training a deep learning model that can automatically generate descriptive text captions for a given image.

### Problem Statement & Goal
The main goal was to create a model that bridges computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). Given an image, the model should output a grammatically correct and contextually relevant sentence describing the scene, objects, and actions within that image.

### My Role
I was the sole developer for this project, responsible for all stages from data preprocessing and model architecture design to training, evaluation, and implementation.

### Architecture & Methodology
The model utilizes an **encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism**, a standard approach for this task.
* **Encoder:** A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically **InceptionV3**, is used to extract high-level feature vectors from the input image. I froze the weights of the pre-trained model to leverage its powerful image feature extraction capabilities without the need for extensive training.
* **Decoder:** A **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network acts as the decoder. It takes the encoded image features and generates the caption word by word.
* **Attention Mechanism:** A **Bahdanau-style attention mechanism** was implemented. At each step of generating a word, the attention mechanism allows the LSTM decoder to focus on the most relevant parts of the image. This is crucial for generating more accurate and detailed captions, especially for complex scenes.

### Key Technical Challenges
1.  **Data Pipeline:** The Flickr8k dataset used required significant preprocessing, including cleaning captions, creating a vocabulary, and setting up a data loader that could efficiently feed images and tokenized captions to the model.
2.  **Implementing Attention:** Correctly implementing the attention mechanism and ensuring the context vector was properly calculated and fed into the LSTM at each timestep was a complex but critical task.
3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the optimal learning rate, embedding size, and hidden units for the LSTM decoder required numerous experiments to avoid issues like slow convergence or overfitting.

### Solutions & Key Features
* **Efficient Data Handling:** Created a custom PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader` to handle image transformations and caption padding, which streamlined the training process.
* **Attention Visualization:** Implemented a feature to visualize the attention weights on the image for a given generated caption. This allowed me to "see" what part of the image the model was focusing on for each word, which was invaluable for debugging and understanding the model's behavior.
* **Beam Search:** For inference, I implemented a beam search algorithm instead of a simple greedy search. This allows the model to generate more fluent and accurate captions by considering multiple potential word sequences at each step.

### Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **PyTorch:** For building and training the entire deep learning model.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **SpaCy:** For text processing and tokenization of the captions.
* **Matplotlib & Pillow:** For image handling.
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** For experimentation and model development.

### Personal Learnings
This project was a fantastic deep dive into the intersection of CV, NLP and Attention Mechanism. I gained a practical, in-depth understanding of encoder-decoder architectures and the significant impact of attention mechanisms. Visualizing the attention scores was a key learning moment, as it made an abstract concept tangible and demonstrated the model's "thought process."
