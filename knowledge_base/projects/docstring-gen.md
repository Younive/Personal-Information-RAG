# Project Deep Dive: Fine-Tuning an LLM for Specialized Q&A

This project involved taking a pre-trained open-source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it to become a specialized chatbot capable of answering questions about a specific domainâ€”in this case, the fundamentals of PyTorch.

### Problem Statement & Goal
General-purpose LLMs are powerful but can sometimes provide generic or incorrect answers for niche, technical topics. The goal was to create a more reliable and accurate chatbot by fine-tuning a base model on a curated dataset of questions and answers related to the PyTorch deep learning framework.

### My Role
I was the sole developer for this project. My work included dataset creation, selecting a base model, implementing the fine-tuning process, and evaluating the final model.

### Architecture & Methodology
* **Base Model:** I selected Google's **Gemma 2B**, a powerful yet relatively lightweight open-source LLM suitable for fine-tuning on consumer hardware.
* **Fine-Tuning Technique:** To make the training process computationally feasible, I used a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method called **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**. Instead of retraining all the model's billions of parameters, LoRA adds small, trainable "adapter" matrices, dramatically reducing memory requirements.
* **Quantization:** I used **4-bit quantization** via the `bitsandbytes` library to load the large base model into my GPU's limited VRAM.

### Key Technical Challenges
1.  **Dataset Curation:** The success of fine-tuning is highly dependent on the quality of the dataset. Creating a clean, diverse, and accurate set of several hundred question-answer pairs about PyTorch was the most time-consuming part of the project.
2.  **Resource Management:** Even with PEFT and quantization, fine-tuning an LLM requires careful management of GPU memory to avoid out-of-memory errors. Finding the right batch size and LoRA configuration was crucial.
3.  **Evaluation:** Evaluating a generative Q&A model is non-trivial. I had to go beyond simple accuracy and create a set of test prompts to qualitatively assess the model's fluency, accuracy, and "helpfulness" compared to the base model.

### Solutions & Key Features
* **Structured Dataset:** I created a structured JSONL file of question-answer pairs formatted for instruction-based fine-tuning.
* **Hugging Face Ecosystem:** The project heavily leveraged the Hugging Face ecosystem, including the `transformers` library for loading the model, `datasets` for handling the data, and `peft` for implementing LoRA.
* **Clear Improvement:** The final fine-tuned model demonstrated a clear improvement in providing specific, accurate, and code-supported answers to PyTorch-related questions compared to the general-purpose base model.

### Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **PyTorch**
* **Hugging Face Libraries:**
    * `transformers`
    * `peft` (for LoRA)
    * `trl` (Transformer Reinforcement Learning, for the SFTTrainer)
    * `datasets`
* **`bitsandbytes`:** For 4-bit quantization.
* **Google Colab/Kaggle:** Utilized for accessing free GPU resources for training.

### Personal Learnings
This project was a practical introduction to the modern LLM development lifecycle. I learned that data quality is paramount and that techniques like LoRA and quantization are essential for making LLM fine-tuning accessible. It was incredibly rewarding to see a general-purpose model learn to become a "specialist" in a topic I defined.
