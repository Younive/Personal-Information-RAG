# About Me

My name is Siriwut Thongmak (you can call me Kan). I am an aspiring AI/ML Engineer with a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and software development.

Over the past year, I have passionately pursued this interest by independently developing a diverse portfolio of AI projects. These span areas like computer vision (including a highlight project on Image Captioning with Attention Mechanism), natural language processing, and the fine-tuning of large language models (such as my work on Fine-Tuning LLM).

My journey in AI has been one of continuous learning. I undertook a dedicated period from early 2024 to early 2025 for intensive self-study and skill enhancement in AI and Machine Learning. This time also allowed for personal recalibration, ensuring I approached subsequent opportunities with renewed vigor and a significantly strengthened technical toolkit in areas like Pytorch for advance Machine Learning topics and deploying machine learning models (MLOps/LLMOps).

Beyond these hands-on projects, my experience as a volunteer machine learning tutor—where I taught algorithms and reviewed student code—and as a teaching assistant for embedded systems, has significantly sharpened both my technical expertise and my communication abilities. I am eager to apply these skills and my enthusiasm for leveraging AI to solve real-world challenges in a professional capacity.
